# What's This Directory About?

This directory contains a project that you can fork and then open in a special way in VSCode to produce empty but up-and-running mathematical development environment ready for use. To use it, please (1) fork it, (2) copy the clone URL for your new repo into your copy buffer, (3) clone your fork to your local machine, (3) open the new folder in VSCode, (4) let VSCode build and boot the development environment container, (5) open a terminal and run leanproject build. This will take some minutes the first time through but will be much quicker on subsequent development sessions.
