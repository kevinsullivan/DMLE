 # Directory containing Lean source files

 The Lean Prover is configured here to expect all Lean files to be in the /src folder relative to the top-level project directory. 
 
 
 We bootstrapped this directory with a single Lean file 
 you can use to check that everything's working. Open the
 src/lean_test_mathlib.lean file and use the instructions
 contained therein to determine that everything is working.
