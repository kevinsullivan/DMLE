 # Directory containing Lean source files

 The Lean Prover is configured to expect all Lean files to 
 be in the /src folder relative to the project directory. We
 have bootstrapped this directory with a single file that 
 you can use to check that everything is working. Open the
 src/lean_test_mathlib.lean file and use the instructions
 contained therein to determine that everything is working.
